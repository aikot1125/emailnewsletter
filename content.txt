Assawaga Farm
:Vendor1 story:
Located in the "quiet corner" of Connecticut, Assawaga Farm is a small, diversified vegetable farm specializing in Japanese varieties of vegetables and mushrooms. Yoko Takemura and Alex Carpenter bought the land back in 2016 and since then, they are transforming the once hay field into a productive farm using human-scale tools and minimum tillage techniques. Check out their most recent addition to their veggie line-up, the burdock root (gobo in Japanese) this Saturday!
